    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where trusted source data is available, inserting relevant content into the input prompt greatly reduces the likelihood of LLM hallucinations. This \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\" pattern can be used in deterministic flows, but also applied to AI Agents which might work with multiple knowledge repositories or other API tools and decide when to call each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **RAG isn't perfect**: Our knowledgebase might not contain relevant information to answer a question, or the wording of the content or question could make it difficult for search engines to retrieve the necessary data. In these cases:\n",
    "1. The LLM might generate answers that are **irrelevant** to the user's actual question - distracted by irrelevant search results\n",
    "2. We might still generate **ungrounded** answers that aren't fully faithful to the source content - especially if its relationship to the question is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these risks, contextual grounding checks like those provided in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provide an extra layer of safety for high-performing RAG-like systems - including AI Agents and MCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "When building production agents with hallucination mitigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Always use RAG** for domain-specific or up-to-date information\n",
    "- ✅ **Add guardrails** for high-stakes applications where accuracy is critical\n",
    "- ✅ **Configure appropriate thresholds** based on your use case (stricter for medical/legal, more relaxed for general queries)\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitor guardrail interventions** to identify areas where your knowledge base may need improvement\n",
    "- ✅ **Provide fallback responses** when guardrails block a response, guiding users on how to rephrase their query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Guardrail Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond contextual grounding, AWS Bedrock Guardrails also support:\n",
    "- **Content filtering**: Block harmful, inappropriate, or sensitive content\n",
    "- **PII detection**: Prevent leakage of personally identifiable information\n",
    "- **Topic blocking**: Restrict conversations to approved topics\n",
    "- **Custom word filters**: Block specific terms or phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the [Bedrock Guardrails documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) to learn more about these features."
