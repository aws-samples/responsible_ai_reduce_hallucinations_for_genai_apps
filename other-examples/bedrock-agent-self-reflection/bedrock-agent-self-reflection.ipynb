    "# Self-Reflecting Agents with Guardrails on Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "> **As featured in AWS re:Invent 2024 session AIM325**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the pattern discussed in the AWS ML Blog post *[\"Reducing hallucinations in large language models with custom intervention using Amazon Bedrock Agents\"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/reducing-hallucinations-in-large-language-models-with-custom-intervention-using-amazon-bedrock-agents/)*: We'll set up an [Amazon Bedrock Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) to conduct an additional check for hallucinations when it deems necessary - and then either 1/ continue responding to the user, or 2/ request them to wait while a human operator is notified to join and assist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the [bedrock-knowledge-base-guardrails](../bedrock-knowledge-base-guardrails/) example, [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) provide a fully-managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, supporting built-in [contextual grounding and answer relevance checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-contextual-grounding-check.html) by Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example though, we'll explore implementing **custom** grounding checks using Open Source library [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/); and **agentic** orchestration with [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-how.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented flow will be as follows, shown also in the architecture diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. (Offline / in advance) Trusted documents are ingested from Amazon S3 into the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "1. The user asks the agent a question relevant to the documentation\n",
    "2. The **agent decides** that the knowledge base will be useful to support its answer, and searches the Bedrock Knowledge Base for relevant content\n",
    "3. The Bedrock Knowledge Base vectorizes the search query and performs the search in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless - the underlying vector store\n",
    "4. Relevant documentation \"chunks\" are retrieved\n",
    "5. Based on the retrieved chunks, an answer is drafted by the LLM\n",
    "6. The **agent decides** (based on its system prompt guidance) that this is an appropriate situation to invoke its configured hallucination/grounding checker tool\n",
    "7. The agent tool request is mapped to an AWS Lambda function which checks the proposed answer using Ragas metrics\n",
    "8. If the check fails, the tool sends an Amazon SNS notification requesting a human operator to intervene and support\n",
    "9. The checker tool responds telling the agent how to respond based on the result of the check\n",
    "10. The agent either returns the validated response to the user, or an override message asking them to wait while a human operator joins the chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/lab2-reinvent-arch-diagram-v1.png \"This image shows the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system design setup with knowledge bases, S3, and AOSS. Knowledge corpus is ingested into a vector database using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base Agent and then RAG approach is used to work question answering. The question is converted into embeddings followed by semantic similarity search to get similar documents. With the user prompt being augmented with the RAG search response, the LLM is invoked to get the final raw response for the user.\")"

    "1. How Open Source libraries like [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/) can be used to build custom hallucination detection guardrails apart from Amazon Bedrock's built-in [Guardrail features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html)\n",
    "2. A more-advanced \"guardrail-as-a-tool\" pattern in which agents can be given autonomy to decide for themselves when to run additional checks on generated answers - versus more rule-based guardrail workflows.\n",

    "In general, it's often useful to start from fully-managed options like Amazon Bedrock Guardrails first - and enable those deterministically to run on every agent invocation. However, these alternative patterns could be useful in cases where more custom, domain-specific checks are needed or it's shown the agent is reliably able to determine when a guardrail check is relevant - reducing potential guardrail costs."
