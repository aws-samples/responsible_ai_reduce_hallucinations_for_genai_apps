    "## Detecting LLM Hallucinations Through Response Consistency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For many applications built on closed-source, proprietary models accessed via APIs, we don't have access to the model's internal states (like weights or logits) or ground truth data to compare against. **Response Level Detection** techniques are designed for this scenario, treating the model as an opaque system and relying only on its input-output behavior to assess reliability and detect potential hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement and compare three cutting-edge response level detection methods that work without requiring reference answers or model internals. These methods analyze the **consistency and coherence of multiple model responses** to the same prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement and compare three cutting-edge detection methods:\n",
    "1. **Semantic Similarity Analysis** - Measuring consistency across multiple model responses using embeddings\n",
    "2. **Non-Contradiction Probability** - Using Natural Language Inference (NLI) to detect logical contradictions\n",
    "3. **Normalized Semantic Negentropy (NSN)** - Measuring semantic uncertainty through response clustering\n",

    "- You don't have ground truth answers to compare against\n",
    "- You need to assess model reliability in production without access to model internals\n",
    "- You want to identify when a model is \"making things up\"\n",
    "- You need to implement confidence scoring for AI responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach leverages the principle that **reliable knowledge should be consistent** across multiple generations with different sampling parameters, while hallucinations tend to vary significantly.\n",

Open Source libraries like [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/models) and [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) offer standardised wrappers for a wide variety of LLM hosting providers, but it's also pretty easy to build your own if you value minimizing dependencies - which is what we've done here.

    "(<a href=\"#top\">Go to top</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've applied these techniques on basic LLM calls. But how can they fit in more complex AI applications like agents? In this section, we'll integrate real-time, response-level hallucination detection into an example agent using the Strands Agents SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Strands Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Strands](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) is an open-source Python framework for building agentic AI applications. It provides:\n",
    "- **Unified Model Interface**: Work with multiple LLM providers (including Bedrock, SageMaker, and others outside AWS)\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Connect agents to external tools and APIs\n",
    "- **Observability**: Built-in tracing and monitoring via OpenTelemetry\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Easy to add custom behaviors like hallucination detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach: Semantic Similarity as a Model-Level Guardrail\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build an agent that:\n",
    "1. **Generates multiple candidate responses** every time it calls its core LLM\n",
    "2. **Analyzes semantic similarity** between the candidate responses\n",
    "3. **Logs the analysis results** to standard tracing & observability tools\n",
    "4. **Intervenes if inconsistency is detected** (potential hallucination)\n",
    "5. **Returns the most reliable response** or raises an alert\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents; which typically go through multiple rounds of LLM inference and external tool calls before returning a final answer to the user; are a more complex environment for implementing guardrails than a single LLM call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tool calls, like internal APIs, may be **irreversible, or at least complicated to undo**: So implementing this guardrail at the level of each LLM call (as we've done here) is more generalizable than trying to invoke the *whole agent* several times in parallel and analysing the final responses. However, that approach could also be viable for agents that **only** have information-fetching, read-only tools."

    "### Production Deployment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When deploying this pattern to production, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Performance vs. Accuracy Tradeoffs\n",
    "- **Latency**: Running 3 parallel model calls increases latency slightly, but reduces wall-clock time vs. sequential calls\n",
    "- **Cost**: 3x model invocations = 3x cost per query\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Use caching, reduce `num_candidates` for non-critical queries, or use faster/cheaper models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Threshold Tuning\n",
    "- **similarity_threshold=0.75** is a starting point - tune based on your domain\n",
    "- Lower threshold (e.g., 0.6) = fewer false positives, but might miss hallucinations\n",
    "- Higher threshold (e.g., 0.9) = stricter checking, but might flag legitimate variation\n",
    "- Use A/B testing and human evaluation to find optimal threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Error Handling\n",
    "- Current implementation prints warnings but returns a response anyway\n",
    "- In production, you might:\n",
    "  - Raise an exception to force human review\n",
    "  - Return a confidence score to the user\n",
    "  - Fallback to a RAG system or web search\n",
    "  - Log to monitoring system for offline analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Observability\n",
    "- Enable Langfuse or another observability platform\n",
    "- Track metrics: `mean_similarity`, `intervention_rate`, `user_satisfaction`\n",
    "- Set up alerts when intervention rate exceeds normal baselines\n",
    "- Review flagged responses to improve prompts and thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Advanced Consolidation Strategies\n",
    "- Current implementation returns the first response\n",
    "- Alternatives:\n",
    "  - Return the response with **highest average similarity** to others\n",
    "  - Use **majority voting** for classification tasks\n",
    "  - **Blend responses** for creative tasks\n",
    "  - Apply **secondary checks** (e.g., NLI contradiction detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Multi-Model Ensembles\n",
    "- Instead of calling the same model 3x, call different models:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  models = [\n",
    "      BedrockModel(\"claude-haiku-4-5\"),\n",
    "      BedrockModel(\"claude-3-5-sonnet\"),\n",
    "      # Could even mix SageMaker models, etc.\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ensemble_model = SemanticSimilarityModel(models)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Provides diversity and can catch model-specific hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Integration with Other Guardrails\n",
    "- Combine with **Bedrock Guardrails** for content filtering\n",
    "- Add **contextual grounding** checks if using RAG\n",
    "- Layer with **Token Probability Level methods** (perplexity, entropy) for more robust detection\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Considerations**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> These methods have higher latency and computational cost due to multiple model generations and additional processing. However, Section 6 demonstrates how to mitigate this through parallel execution and production optimization strategies. These methods are valuable for high-stakes applications where accuracy is critical, and can be combined with faster methods for different use cases."

    "\n",
    "### What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored three powerful Response Level techniques for detecting LLM hallucinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Similarity Detection** - Fast and effective for detecting response consistency\n",
    "2. **Non-Contradiction Probability** - Excellent for identifying logical inconsistencies  \n",
    "3. **Normalized Semantic Negentropy** - Most sophisticated, measuring semantic uncertainty\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | What It Detects | When to Use (High-Level Context) | Why It Works |\n",
    "|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Semantic Similarity Detection** | Inconsistent knowledge across multiple generations | • **Content verification** where consistency matters<br>• **Knowledge validation** with available compute budget<br>• **Quick consistency checks** for important claims | True knowledge should be expressed the same way repeatedly - if answers vary wildly, the model isn't really \"sure\" |\n",
    "| **Non-Contradiction Probability** | Logical inconsistencies between responses | • **Factual content** where contradictions are unacceptable<br>• **Research applications** requiring logical coherence<br>• **Decision support** systems with clear right/wrong answers | Real facts don't contradict themselves - if multiple responses conflict, at least one must be wrong |\n",
    "| **Normalized Semantic Negentropy** | Semantic uncertainty through response clustering | • **High-precision applications** requiring confidence scores<br>• **Research environments** with computational resources<br>• **Advanced quality control** for critical outputs | Confident knowledge produces similar responses that cluster together - scattered responses indicate uncertainty |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No single method is perfect** - Different techniques catch different types of hallucinations\n",
    "- **Model quality varies significantly** - Some models are much more consistent than others\n",
    "- **Question type matters** - Factual questions and creative prompts require different approaches\n",
    "- **Confidence thresholds are domain-specific** - Adjust based on your use case criticality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Multiple Methods**: Combine techniques for more robust detection\n",
    "2. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Adjust confidence levels based on domain requirements\n",
    "3. **Consider Computational Cost**: Balance accuracy with response time needs\n",
    "4. **Monitor and Adapt**: Continuously evaluate and update detection parameters\n",
    "5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Always have escalation paths for uncertain cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrate with existing systems**: Add hallucination detection to your AI pipelines\n",
    "- **Build domain-specific datasets**: Create evaluation sets for your specific use cases\n",
    "- **Experiment with ensemble methods**: Combine multiple models and detection techniques\n",
    "- **Explore fine-tuning**: Train models to be more consistent in your domain\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
